        it was somehow hard to adapt here since she was always close to her mom 
        and now 2miles away from her, but this was not the only reason I mean it is not easy to adopt to a new environment
        moreso an enclosed one ,but either way she adopted .she studied upto to form four in the same school but in form four the 
        studies became harder but being an optimist she tried her best.She did her end of high school exam ie ;KCSE which  she did not perform very well she obtained a mean grade c+

        This is the best part ;after highschool she was confused on what to do and where to start from.But after the end of January the 
        sun shown her way and she joined a program "INSPIRE YOUTH IN STEM " offered by her dream campus JKUAT
        which was to run in two months .This is her current whereabout .:here is my advise to you as long as you haven'nt taken the first step you cant just wait for outcomes.
